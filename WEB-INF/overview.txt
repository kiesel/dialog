How it works
============
<item>[[image/organize.png]]
Organize
~~~~~~~~
Download the pictures from your camera into any directory. Sort the bad or 
duplicate ones out, edit them, correct their colors. Select your favorite 
ones to become highlights.
</item>

<item>[[image/import.png]]
Import
~~~~~~
Use the import utility to add all the pictures in the origin directory to
your Dialog installation. This will generate thumbnails and larger images,
extract meta information (such as EXIF and IPTC data), group the images
into different categories and create the index information for your website.
</item>

<item>[[image/publish.png]]
Publish
~~~~~~~
Start the publisher to upload all generated data to your webspace. This 
includes pictures and meta information so the website doesn't have to 
perform any lengthy calculations online - it will be "good" to your server.
</item>

<item>[[image/view.png]]
View
~~~~
Done: Your pictures are now online! To see what that could look like, you
can have a look at [http://dialog.friebes.info/ Timm's] and 
[http://dialog.kiesel.name/ Alex'] setups.

Get it!
=======
If you'd like to use Dialog to publish your photography work, start by
downloading the most recent version. What version contains which features
can be seen in the [project://releases releases] page, but the newest one
is surely the one you want! After you've saved the release file, follow the 
[docs://setup setup document] for a step-by-step guide to installing it 
on your computer and on your webspace.
